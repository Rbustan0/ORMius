# ORMius

## Description 
This repository contains models created through a schema and sequelize extension that simulates a backend database for an ecommerce application. We were given starter code to create the models in and build routes that would manipulate and change the models in the database depending on the user's hypothetical input.

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following commands (assuming you are on git bash and already have node.js/nodemon installed):

1. Clone the repository where you want to save the code:  
```
git clone [HTTPS/SSH/CLI link]
``` 

2. Navigate over to files in terminal
3. Type in terminal:  
``` 
npm i
```   
4. Run the schema.sql in your local machine and change connection details to match your root and password values.

5. Issue the following command to populate your database with seeds:

```
node seeds/index.js
```

6. Run either commands through node in the terminal:  
```
 node server.js

```
 nodemon server.js
``` 

7. Run a popular REST client (such as insomnia) to interact with the API and test its API functionality.

## Usage

This program can be used to observe how js can tie in with mysql2 through using an ORM framework such as sequelize. Users can also learn and understand how it ties in with express framework as well as how everything connects in general backend coding with javascript. This program can be used to test and observe how sequelize as well connects with different tables in the database as well.
